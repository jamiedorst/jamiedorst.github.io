              <p className="skinnyText bottomM3">
                Since the COVID-19 pandemic, VMware employees have been working
                from home. This brought about its own set of challenges and
                benefits, but one thing that was unclear was how our colleagues
                were performing office-reliant tasks such as printing, from
                home. We wanted to explore how people's printing needs had
                changed since becoming remote, and how the Global Print team
                might continue to provide excellent service.
              </p>
              <h5 className="names skinnyText">SOLUTION</h5>
              <p className="skinnyText bottomM3">
                Through global surveys and interviews, I was able to gain a much
                better understanding of what people's needs are, and how they
                currently are or are not being met. Through this I also ideated
                upon solutions and presented those to the Global Print team.{" "}

                I was the head of this project, and led it from start to finish.
                I wrote and distributed the survey, as well as conducted all of
                the 1:1 interviews. I then analyzed all of the quantitative and
                qualitative data myself, and compiled what I had found into a
                slide deck to present to leadership. I got lots of help along
                the way with reviewing and checking my work from my wonderful
                colleagues, but the bulk of the work done and decision-making
                was done by me.

                    I discovered that there are four main categories that
                    printers at VMware fall under. These cateogires would
                    heavily influence any solutions the Global Print team would

              <p className="skinnyText bottomM3">
                I decided to start my research with a survey so that I could get
                a better, general understanding of why/how often people print,
                how important it is for their role, and how the remote
                transition has affected them. The survey was sent out globally
                to 30 frequent users in each of the seven business units that
                used printing services most in 2019. This allowed me to reach a
                variety of locations and job roles, ensuring I would not be
                excluding any important voices. This had a 24% response rate.
              </p>
              <h5 className="names skinnyText">INTERVIEWS</h5>
              <p className="skinnyText bottomM3">
                After the survey I conducted 19 1:1 interviews with willing
                participants. These allowed me to dig a little depeper into why
                people use printing, and what their specific challenges have
                been. This would help me better understand what nuances the
                print team had to be aware of when implementing solutions, and
                also was an opportunity to ideate upon ideas with participants.
                Participants were sourced through an opt-in question at the end
                of the survey, and was a global group with representation from
                all seven target business units.

              <h5 className="names skinnyText">FINDINGS</h5>
              <p className="skinnyText">
                <span className="italics">
                  Again, because much of the work I did in this project has not
                  been publicly released, I am unable to disclose my findings in
                  detail. I will share general ideas here, but contact me to
                  learn more.

              <p className=" bottomM3">
                Some interesting quantitative data came from the survey, giving
                me insight as to what the printing population at VMware looks
                like, specifically when remote. The interviews gave me more
                in-depth information about people's experiences, and through
                them I found four main types of print users. These four
                categories would help guide how we address the remote printing
                problemâ€“they demonstrate that there is no one-size-fits-all
                solution. After uncovering and exploring these four categories,
                I was able to present multiple ideas to the team in the context
                of these user types, and identify which ideas would primarily
                benefit which groups.
